Status:Charged Off,n,https://lendingclub.com/browse/loanDetail.action?loan_id=352645,"I am requesting this loan to finish my elective requirements for my Bachelor in Business Administration degree.  Since I am currently in school at Baker University and already using my allotted financial I find myself in a situation where I will finish my degree program in 10 months but left with over 32 hours of electives to take.  Those of you who are not familiar with the Baker University program, students are able to finish their core degree requirements on a flexible schedule (1 class at a time) that caters towards working professionals.  However, since I went into the program with 32 hours of electives still to take. When my program concludes in May, 2009, I will still be left with 32 hours of credits to take before I officially receive my business degree. That’s why I have opted to finish up these elective credits at my local community college over the next two semesters. Unfortunately, JCCC does not offer financial aid to students not enrolled in degree programs. However, an advantage of taking class at a community college is that tuition is less expensive and I still have the flexibility of taking classes online.  Having my degree in hand will open me to the opportunity of promotion at work and in the end more income potential.

First, $ 4,000 will be used to pay off credit cards, taking me well below the 35 % available credit level, which should take my credit score to the 730 - 740 range.    I finally feel that I can justify buying a California home and want to obtain the best interest rate I can.  The remaining $ 10,000 will be allotted for my August wedding.  I am trying for a $ 7,000 budget, but am aware that last minute costs often come up and I wish to avoid going to my credit cards.  Any funds not used for the wedding, plus all wedding gift monies will be applied to completely paying off all credit cards.

I have a full time job as a fire fighter; and a part time job working at a big box home improvement store with an average of 30hrs a week. I've more than doubled monthly payments and also made an extra payment per month in the past. Its just that my payments were spread over three cards so it doesnt feel like I was redusing the debt as fast as i'd like.  Considering this economy, I believe I have one of the few careers where the thought of getting laid off is close to nill and it also provideds substancial pay increases over the span of my career.  In the past I received a loan of 5K and change that was paid off earlier than the 18 months while I only had one job.

I just want to get something slightly more reliable to get back and forth to work with.  I'd normally pay cash but want to stay as liquid as possible so I'm getting a loan for about 50% of the cost of the truck. The rest I'll be paying for with cash.  Because the truck is older than 10 years, I can't get an auto-loan for it. Thanks!<br/> Borrower added on 06/06/11 > Additional: By &quot;very old&quot; I mean '73.  I've quite literally been driving it with a hole in the floor for almost a year. That's how stingy I am with my money. I've done the research and it's not worth putting money into since the body and frame are pretty much beyond repair. I'm going to make sure to buy something like an F150 or Tacoma, which are very prevalent.
