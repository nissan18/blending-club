I would like to have my payments lower.  549920 added on 10/09/09 > My bills are currently almost $3000 per month, This includes rent, car payment, utilities and other credit accounts.  With this loan, I will be able to pay off my accounts much faster by consolidating 4 of my smaller debt accounts into one larger one. By giving me this loan I will be able to pay off this particular account in three years or less very easily. I just finished twelve years of military service, and was asked to return to my old job as a DOD employee. The doctor I worked with thought very highly of me to offer this job to me. My pay is salary based so my pay stays the same regardless of hours worked, with the exception of overtime. My job is very stable being in the medical field and taking care of Soliders, Retirees, Veterns and their families. Please consider me for this loan as it will help me with my monthly payments. Thank you so very much. 549920 added on 10/10/09 > The first sentence was for a different amount than the $7,000 currently being offered. With the new amount of $7,000 I will have no problem with paying the monthly payment that will be required. With my current budget adding up to almost $3,000 per month with this consolidation will put me about $2,500 per month which will allow me to pay extra on this debt and start a savings account. 549920 added on 10/11/09 > I am trying to raise my credit score by deleting the amount of open credit accounts I have.

I have an excellent record of repaying loans and other debts and a very good credit rating but due to the recent legislative changes to credit card regulations (i.e., my credit lines have been lowered to just over my balance) appear to have too high of a credit:balance ratio so can not get a bank loan. Besides, I'd rather see private investor earning from the interest rather than the banks.

The additional $500 will cover my closing costs and some of the very minor repair work that is needed.  This property will not have a mortgage against it because the loan amount would be so small.  This home was previously rented for $450, which is what I plan on asking for it.  My insurance, taxes, and management costs will run about $125, which leaves $325 to cover the cost of my loan at about $287 per month.    In the event that the unit is vacant I can easily cover the payment from my other rental income (net $900/month) or from my salary (net $4,700/month).

Within a month after that, our septic tank had to be repaired.  I have a very steady job in health care and always pay my bills.  My credit score is not perfect due to the amount of debt I have in student loans and credit card debt from medical bills for my husband from 2008, but we make all our payments and have no delinquent accounts, and we never have.  I have never filed for bankruptcy, and have no collections or past due payments on my credit. I can assure anyone who funds my loan, it will be used to help reduce this high interest debt and I will pay off the debt in full.

I am a reliable borrower because I have never been late on any payments and have always paid on time throughout my credit history.  I have a well paying job as a Business Development Manager for a Green Recycling Company that is in process of expanding.  I could afford payments and slowly eliminate my debt without any issues but the high interest rates charged by these banks makes it difficult to lower the numbers.  I also live with family so I have no rent costs and basically my highest expense is my debt. 556491 added on 10/14/09 > Since I've been asked other questions, here are some other details that may provide further assurance to potential investors.  I am the sole earner of my month wages listed and my car is paid in full.  Any student loans I had are being taken care of by family members.  The rest of the credit debt I'm not loaning for has little to no interest rates so I'm just mainly looking to eliminate the debt that has high interest rates.  Please let me know if there are any other questions. 556491 added on 10/18/09 > Another question I've been asked was what measures have I been taking to eliminate debt.  I don't ever use credit cards anymore eliminating any additional debt.  Moving back with my family members have cut my costs down and my company just started to pay for my cellular bills.  Besides regular expenses such as basic necessities, I've limited all my expenses down to eliminate the debt as soon as possible.  Since the interest rates have increased significantly in the past half year for a few of my accounts, I can only imagine it'll take much longer than anticipated.

With the current drop in housing prices, we no longer have the available equity to borrow against the house.  Even though we are expecting cash in the Spring (which we would use to pay back the loan), we are looking to acquire some interim financing to get started right away as the adoption process can be drawn out and cumbersome.  A seven-month delay will add to that process, as the funds are needed upfront, so we would not be able to begin until then.  Our credit balances may be a bit high, but as you can see we have never missed a payment and we are not actively looking for any new credit besides looking for adoption financing.

I have spent several months working on the business plan and I believe that Kirksville offers a great location for an arcade to thrive.  The majority of the start-up budget will go towards the purchase of arcade machines, which will be bought used and will retain most of their value as long as they are kept in working order.   The rest of the money will go towards advertising, business registration fees, and working capital for the first few months.  I am a full-time student with a steady part-time job and I will not rely on income from the arcade to pay my living expenses.  Additionally, in July 2009, I will receive $25,000 from a trust.
