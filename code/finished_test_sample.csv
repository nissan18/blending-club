My main employment is with my spouse's internet business.  Rather than a set salary, we pay all our expenses through the business, along with Social Security and pension funds.  I have been employed at this business for over 10 years.  The house I live in is also in my spouse's name, it is completely paid for and mortgage-free.  However, I would not use my home as collateral for this loan, instead, I would use my truck, which has a value of $7,500.00.  It is my intention that this sideline business pay for itself rather than rely on any co-mingled funds, thus the loan request for upgrading my services.

The group was started three years ago on meetup.com, and has now grown to over 900 members, its membership steadily increasing even with people joining and leaving every day. We have regular meetings at a local bookstore, where the average attendance is about 50 people at each official monthly meeting. We also hold photo outings and workshops in the interim between meetings, with an average of about 20 to 30 participants.  We're currently expanding our operations to include a fully functional social networking website, where members can log on, have their own page and portfolio space, talk on the forums, post events to the calendar, and patronize local businesses whom we've partnered with in exchange for a group discount on their services. We'll of course be selling adspace as well as using more innovative techniques for taking in revenue, such as hosting links to amazon.com for photography-related books and other such photography-related products and services.  We've already begun construction of the site, and we've already invested a fair amount into the group (around $2,000), which has yielded a great amount of success. However, to go further we'll need a relatively small loan of $3,000 to ensure the website's completion and full working order. The loan will also allow us to furnish the group with technological necessities (a dedicated computer and eventually a digital projector) which allow for the group to be regularly maintained and developed. The group's presence and success can be observed publicly at its current online location: photo.meetup.com/438, where anyone can see the number of members, previous meetings and their attendance, and the nearly unanimous praise for the group and its activities.  Having three years under our belt has taught us a great deal about how to interact with the community and how to provide a true service without charging for basic membership or normal activities. Our aim is to keep this model at all costs and to only charge for services and opportunities provided which are ""above and beyond"" the normal routines of the group and the corresponding benefit to its members. In this case, such ""above and beyond"" circumstances include participation in group showings at local galleries (which generally charge a utilization fee for us to use in the first place) as well as premium member account benefits on the website that's currently under construction (such as unlimited uploading of photos, fewer ads, etc.).  My own credit rating is reputable enough, as you can see, and I've never made a late payment. As an investor in this business, you can expect the same reliability in the returns you'll be provided with, given your interest and participation in this loan. Thank you greatly for your time, and I look forward to working with you indirectly as a partner in this project.",small_business,The Austin Photography Group,787xx,TX,0.95,0.0,May-1991,760,764,0.0,34.0,,4.0,0.0,1870,5.5%,5.0,f,0.0,0.0,3450.1882087890003,3450.19,3000.0,450.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,May-2012,111.0,,May-2012,824,820,0.0,,1,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

The rental property is a 3 family triple decker, which are common in this part of the Northeast.  I purchased this property almost 3 years ago and want to get it updated and keep it properly maintained.  The contractors being used are all small local businesses.    The improvements are:  -Exterior painting and staining (painting the top two stories & staining the bottom).  I have already paid for 1/2 of the painting and am planning on doing the staining myself, time permitting ($2,330). -Basement stairs need replacing ($500.00). -Install vent fan to 3rd floor apartment ($380) -Purchase and install ceiling fans in 3rd floor apartment ($410).  Tax wise, I will be able to deduct the interest I pay on this loan, so this makes good business sense.  My credit score should be very good and I am a stickler for repaying not only what I owe, but pay it on time!    I am asking for a loan from Lending Club because I was turned down by a local bank.  My ratio (including mortgage) was a few percentage points above what they allow because they deducted 1/3 of my rental income from the calculation.  I was fuming, especially since the paint job is fully deductible, thus increasing my tax refund (and increasing the pay-back potential).
