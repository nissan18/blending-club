Over 5 years it would still exceed the new loan payment.<br/><br/>Based on a $15,280 loan balance I will have $900 to send to my remaining card:<br/><br/>MBNA - $6746 @ 10.99/$135 per month (after the $900 is applied)<br/><br/>If I send what I send now, $135, this will be paid off in 60 months as well.  My ultimate goal is to use all extra funds (i.e. quarterly bonus, tax refund, etc) to pay down faster.  I would like to get MBNA paid off in 36 months and this loan in 48 months.  <br/><br/>Based on my current salary and no extra payments I will be debt free in 60 months and it is only increasing my monthly outlay by $27.<br/><br/>Other bills:<br/><br/>Car - $237 <br/>Cell - $60<br/>Student loan - $89<br/>Insurance - $85<br/><br/>The reason I have so much debt is 1) stupid spending in college (about $8,000 of it) 2) I was in the mortgage business several years back and had to live off my cards to get by during the ""collapse"" and 3) helping my family with some previous hardships.  <br/><br/>I do not use the cards anymore.  I am just only able to send a little more then the minimum so it feels like I am treading water.<br/><br/>My credit report has no late payments, judgments, or collections of any kind.  My last credit pull came in at a 710 FICO (February 2010).  I pay all of my bills on time; I just need to make up for mistakes of the past to be honest.
